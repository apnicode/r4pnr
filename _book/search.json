    "text": "This book is intended to be a living compendium of procedures used in the field of plant nutrition. Because it is housed on GitHub, it is open-source and open-access, allowing interested experts to contribute, either by submitting additional procedures or by editing existing ones. We hope that, over time, this work becomes a source of best practices operationalized routinely by students, staff, and faculty in educational organizations, as well as by professionals in business and industry.\nWe dedicated ourselves to using only software that is open-access. This decision is meant to democratize this guidance for everyone with access to only a computer and the internet. Software applications with hidden fees and paywalls were avoided. All content was produced using Quarto for books, and using GitHub as a repository for all book content, including figures and data sets. Editing was performed in RStudio Desktop, and all code chunks were written in R. When topics related to spreadsheets were addressed, we used Google Sheets.\nWe hope you find this resource useful. If you see ways to improve it, please contact info@apni.net."

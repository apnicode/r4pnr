# Preparing External Data

Before we import data into R, we need to ensure that they are ready. Key things to check are:

-   the way data are organized
-   the labels used
-   data classes

## Data Organization

R requires that data be "[tidy](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html)" According to [@tidyr], tidy data are structured so that:

-   Every column is a variable
-   Every row is an observation of each variable (missing values are also acceptable)
-   Every cell contains only one value

An example of tidy data are shown below in

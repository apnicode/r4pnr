# Preparing External Data

In this chapter, we discuss how to prepare external files that you have access to and can edit. We limit our discussion to spreadsheet files, such as Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets, since they are widely used in plant nutrition research.

We discuss best practices for:

-   organizing data
-   labeling columns
-   denoting missing values
-   using data validation rules

## Organizing Data

R requires that data be "[tidy](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html)" According to [@tidyr], tidy data are structured so that:

-   Each column is a unique variable
-   Every row is an observation for each variable; if no observation exists for a given variable, it is acceptable to use an entry that denotes a missing value
-   Every cell contains only one value

An example of a spreadsheet with tidy data is shown below ().
